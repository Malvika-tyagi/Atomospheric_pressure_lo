# Way to Check

Open Weather Map API Provides the hourly forcast for the next two days from today. 

We can iterate over the 48 hour hourly pressure and get the Timestamp.

Convert that timestamp into datetime format to check hours should be b/w 6am to 6pm.

   -> To Do this we can convert the Timestamp into datetime format by using the Datetime
      library which will return the Datetime Object and from there we can find out the 
      hours we needed. If the Timestamp is between 6am to 6pm then we will consider that
      pressure else we will not consider that pressure.
      
   -> We can send the Email for upto 2 days from today. 

Now Use If else Statement to get check whether the pressure is below 995 millibar. 
If yes then send a mail Using Python's SMTP Protocol. 

SMTP is the Library which can be use to send the email, we can Make a function and call 
that function if the Pressure is below 995 milibar then trigger that function to send the 
email.
